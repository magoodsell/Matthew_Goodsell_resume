Hello Matthew,


Your resumé looks great! For this assignment, here are a couple things I would consider changing. 

There is an unecessary space in your timeframe for your mission (2016 -2017), you could just remove that space.

I noticed that you have periods at the end of your bulletpoints. When you list things with bulletpoints, you don't need punctuation marks at the end of those bulletpoints.


Other than that, it looks like your resumé is very solid.
